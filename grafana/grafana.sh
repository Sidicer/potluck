# Altered by Michael Gmelin
#
# EDIT THE FOLLOWING FOR NEW FLAVOUR:
# 1. RUNS_IN_NOMAD - true or false
# 2. If RUNS_IN_NOMAD is false, can delete the <flavour>+4 file, else
#    make sure pot create command doesn't include it
# 3. Create a matching <flavour> file with this <flavour>.sh file that
#    contains the copy-in commands for the config files from <flavour>.d/
#    Remember that the package directories don't exist yet, so likely copy
#    to /root
# 4. Adjust package installation between BEGIN & END PACKAGE SETUP
# 5. Adjust jail configuration script generation between BEGIN & END COOK
#    Configure the config files that have been copied in where necessary

# Set this to true if this jail flavour is to be created as a nomad (i.e. blocking) jail.
# You can then query it in the cook script generation below and the script is installed
# appropriately at the end of this script
RUNS_IN_NOMAD=false

COOKLOG=/var/log/cook.log
