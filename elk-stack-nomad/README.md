# Overview

This is a ```elasticsearch```/```logstash```/```kibana``` (ELK)  jail that can be started with ```pot``` but it can also be deployed via ```nomad```.

The ```elasticsearch``` storage directory is in ```/var/db/elasticsearch```.
It is suggested that this directory is mounted from outside the jail when it is run as a ```nomad``` task so that it is persistent (see example below).

The ```logstash``` configuration (```logstash.yml```, ```logstash.conf```, ```pipelines.yml```) is located in ```/usr/local/etc/logstash``` and you probably want to copy in your own configuration and potentially mount some source directories that can be accessed depending on your monitoring and aggregation needs.

The ```kibana``` web interface can be accessed via web browser through port 5601.

For more details about ```nomad```images, see [about potluck](https://potluck.honeyguide.net/micro/about-potluck/).

## Note: At the moment, this image has a serious limitation:

* Theoretically, the ```elasticsearch``` database directory can be mounted if on the host one has previously set ```enforce_statfs=1``` (e.g. via ```sysctl```) - see also https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/12018#issuecomment-146840836
* Practically, this still does not work as ```elasticsearch``` fails to start with _java.lang.IllegalStateException: failed to obtain node locks_ - no workaround or solution for this is known at the moment

That means the image does only work without mounting in an outside database directory. That should not be a problem as long as the jail is run stand-alone, but when it is scheduled via ```nomad```, this implies that the database is completely erased on every restart.
To run it this way, remove the line ```          "/mnt/elastic_db:/var/db/elasticsearch"``` from the ```mount``` stanza in the job description example below.


# Nomad Job Description Example

```
job "elkstack" {
  datacenters = ["mydc"]
  type        = "service"

  group "group1" {
    count = 1

    task "www1" {
      driver = "pot"

      service {
        tags = ["elkstack", "www"]
        name = "elkstack"
        port = "http"

         check {
            type     = "tcp"
            name     = "tcp"
            interval = "60s"
            timeout  = "30s"
          }
          check_restart {
            limit = 5
            grace = "120s"
            ignore_warnings = false
          }
      }

      config {
        image = "https://potluck.honeyguide.net/elk-stack-nomad"
        pot = "elk-stack-nomad-amd64-12_1"
        tag = "1.0"
        command = "/usr/local/bin/cook"
        mount = [
          "/mnt/logfiles:/mnt",
          "/mnt/elastic_db:/var/db/elasticsearch"

        ]
        port_map = {
          http = "5601"
        }
      }

      resources {
        cpu = 1000
        memory = 2048

        network {
          mbits = 50
          port "http" {}
        }
      }
    }
